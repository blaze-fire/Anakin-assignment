# Anakin-assignment

* This assignment is to fetch and give the latitudes and longitudes of all the
restaurants on this page. <br>
* For this I used a python package called [selenium-wire](https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire#response-objects) that extends Selenium's Python bindings to give you access to the 
underlying requests made by the browser. You author your code in the same way as you do with Selenium, but you get extra APIs for inspecting 
requests and responses and making changes to them on the fly.
